    <p>
      Communicate with <strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> in Ruby.
      Raw access to the full API without having to handle
      temporary credentials or HTTP requests by yourself.

    <h2>Usage</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Install as a gem using <code>gem install "jedlik"</code> or in your
      gemfile using <code>gem "jedlik"</code>. Jedlik has only one dependency:
      <a href="http://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus">Typhoeus.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Jedlik maps the DynamoDB API closely. Once the connection object
      is ready, all requests are done through <code>#post</code>.
      The first argument is the name of the operation, the second is a hash
      that will be converted to JSON and used as the request body.
    </p>

<pre>
require 'jedlik'

conn = Jedlik::Connection.new 'DG7I54_KEY_ID', 'wr31PP+hu5d76+SECRET_KEY'

conn.post :ListTables    # => {"TableNames"=>["table1", "table2"]}

conn.post :GetItem, {:TableName => "table1", :Key => {:S => "foo"}}
# => Hash
</pre>

    <p>
      It is also possible to pass a string that will be used directly for
      the request body:
    </p>

<pre>
conn.post :GetItem, '{"TableName": "table1", "Key": {"S": "foo"}}'
# => Hash
</pre>
  </div>

  <div class="title">
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The <strong>AWS gem</strong> is quite heavy and does not map the
      DynamoDB API closely enough. Other tools, like
      <a href="http://github.com/Veraticus/Dynamoid">Dynamoid,</a> are
      interesting but try too hard to provide RDBMS-like features to my taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      I did not want to learn a new API after spending hours reading
      DynamoDB's documentation. However, dealing auth AWS authentication
      mechanism manually is daunting and error prone. Jedlik addresses both
      problems by providing a 1:1 mapping to the API while taking care of
      signing requests.
